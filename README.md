## Architecture

### Core Pipeline

1. **Research Phase**: Brave Search API gathers current, authoritative sources
2. **Document Loading**: LangChain WebBaseLoader fetches and parses web content  
3. **Knowledge Indexing**: LlamaIndex creates vector embeddings for RAG
4. **Outline Generation**: LLM creates structured slide outline from research
5. **Content Generation**: Per-slide content with bullet points, notes, and citations
6. **Quality Validation**: Complete thought validation and formatting checks
7. **Presentation Creation**: python-pptx renders professional PowerPoint output

### Key Components

- **Brave Search API**: Web search for current information with rate limiting
- **LangChain WebBaseLoader**: Page fetching with SSL handling and retry logic
- **LlamaIndex Vector Store**: RAG-based content grounding and retrieval
- **Content Quality System**: Validates complete thoughts, prevents repetition
- **Dynamic Formatting**: Auto-adjusts font sizes and layouts for readability
- **Citation Management**: Tracks sources with inline references and bibliography

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required API Keys
BRAVE_API_KEY=brv-************************  # Brave Search API
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-************************   # OpenAI GPT models

# Optional Settings
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o                         # Default: gpt-4o  
USER_AGENT=llm-pptx-deck-builder/1.0        # For web scraping
```

### Rate Limiting

Production-ready rate limiting is implemented for all APIs:

- **Brave Search**: 0.5 req/sec, 30 req/min, 1800 req/hour
- **OpenAI API**: 0.33 req/sec, 20 req/min, 1000 req/hour  
- **Web Scraping**: 2 req/sec, 120 req/min, 7200 req/hour

## Content Quality Features

### Complete Thoughts Validation
- Ensures bullet points express complete thoughts (not necessarily complete sentences)
- Detects incomplete endings with prepositions, conjunctions, and articles
- Validates word count (4-15 words for optimal readability)
- Prevents markdown formatting artifacts

### Anti-Repetition System
- Content allocation planning prevents duplicate insights across slides
- Semantic similarity detection with automated retry mechanisms
- Specialized prompts for different slide types (Introduction, Applications, etc.)

### Title Optimization
- Automatic title-content alignment for semantic harmony
- Replaces generic titles with specific, insight-driven alternatives
- Length management prevents title line wraps (8-word maximum)
- Quote removal and formatting cleanup

## Development

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Test content quality validation
uv run python test_final_validation.py

# Test thought completeness detection
uv run python test_validation_only.py

# Code quality checks
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Templates

Use corporate PowerPoint templates for branded presentations:

```bash
python deck_builder_cli.py \
  --topic "Q4 Financial Results" \
  --template templates/corporate_theme.pptx
```

### API Integration

The system can be integrated into other applications:

```python
from src.deck_builder_agent import DeckBuilderAgent
from src.dependencies import get_dependencies

# Initialize agent
deps = get_dependencies()
agent = DeckBuilderAgent(deps)

# Generate presentation
result = agent.generate_deck("Market Analysis 2025")
print(f"Generated: {result['output_file']}")
```
